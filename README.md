# Project Title - Portfolio (Archived)

This is an archived version of a personal portfolio website built with React. It showcases my work as a web developer. The website includes pages for Home, About, and Contact. Users can navigate to different pages using the navigation bar at the top of the page.

## Code Showcase
- **Routing**: The `App` component in `App.js` sets up the routes for the website using `react-router-dom`. It defines routes for the Home, About, and Contact pages.
- **Navigation**: The `Navbar` component in `Navbar.js` handles the navigation for the website. It uses the `NavLink` from `react-router-dom` for navigation between different pages. The navigation bar is responsive and its state is managed using React's `useState` hook.

This repository is an archived version of a previous project (portfolio-react). The original project was developed in this repository, but due to some deployment issues on Netlify, a new repository was created. This repository is kept for historical reference and will not run even if you execute "npm run". That does not affect the quality or functionality of the code in the new repository.
